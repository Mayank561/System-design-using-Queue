# Backend System Design Using Queue

Design and implement a backend system that efficiently manages requests from multiple users using a queue structure. Each client will have its queue where all requests will be processed sequentially. The system should be robust and scalable, ensuring that the queue is empty once all requests are processed and all users disconnect.

## üöÄ Features

- **Secure User Authentication:**
  - Leverages bcryptjs for robust password hashing, enhancing security.
  - Implements JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure user sessions and authorization.
- **Efficient Request Queueing:**
  - Employs RabbitMQ as a message broker, ensuring requests are queued and processed reliably even under high load.
  - Guarantees First-In-First-Out (FIFO) request processing, maintaining order and fairness.
- **Concurrent Request Handling:**
  - Utilizes worker processes to consume and process requests from the queue concurrently, enhancing throughput and responsiveness.
- **Persistent Data Storage:**
  - Integrates Mongodb as the database, providing reliable storage for user data and application state.
- **Real-time Monitoring and Insights:**
  - Incorporates Prometheus for collecting system metrics and performance data.
  - Provides a `/metrics` endpoint for easy integration with monitoring tools like Grafana, enabling visualization and analysis of system health.
- **Dockerized Deployment:**
  - Uses Docker to containerize the application, simplifying deployment and ensuring environment consistency.
  - Includes a `docker-compose.yaml` file for effortless setup and orchestration of the application, database, and message broker.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Technologies 

- **Backend:**
  - Node.js
  - Express.js
- **Database:**
  - MongoDB
- **Message Queue:**
  - RabbitMQ
- **Security:**
  - bcryptjs (for password hashing)
  - jsonwebtoken (JWT for authentication)
- **Monitoring:**
  - Prometheus
- **Containerization & Orchestration:**
  - Docker
  - Docker Compose

## üîê Authentication Flow

1.  **Registration:**
    - The user submits their username and password.
    - The password is hashed using bcryptjs before being stored securely in the database.
2.  **Login:**
    - The user provides their username and password.
    - The submitted password is hashed and compared against the stored hash for verification.
    - Upon successful authentication, a JWT is generated, signed with a secret key, and sent back to the client.
3.  **Request Authorization:**
    - For subsequent requests requiring authentication, the client includes the JWT in the request headers.
    - The server validates the JWT; if valid, the request is processed; otherwise, it's rejected.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

The system follows a microservice architecture with the following components:

1.  **Client:** Sends requests to the backend API.
2.  **API Server (Node.js/Express.js):**
    - Handles client requests.
    - Authenticates users.
    - Enqueues requests into RabbitMQ.
    - Exposes a `/metrics` endpoint for Prometheus.
3.  **RabbitMQ:** Acts as the message broker, managing request queues.
4.  **Worker Processes (Node.js):**
    - Retrieve requests from RabbitMQ queues.
    - Process the requests (e.g., database interactions, external API calls).
5.  **MongoDb:** Stores persistent user data.

## üöÄ Getting Started

1.  **Prerequisites:**

    - Install Docker and Docker Compose.
    - Install Node.js and npm.

2.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Mayank561/System-design-using-Queue.git
    cd queue-based-system
    ```

3.  **Configure Environment Variables:**

    - Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
    - Set the following environment variables:

    ```bash
    DATABASE_URL= mongodb://username:password@host:port/database
    RABBITMQ_URL=amqp://rabbitmq:5672
    JWT_SECRET_KEY= SECRET_KEY 
    ```

4.  **Start the System:**

    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

    This command will build and run the application, database, and RabbitMQ in Docker containers.

5.  **Access the Application:**

    - The API will be accessible at `http://localhost:8000`.
    - Prometheus metrics will be available at `http://localhost:9090`.
